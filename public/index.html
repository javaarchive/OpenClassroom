  Welcome to Open Classroom
</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Open Classroom</strong> is a online platform for learning. It is
  designed to be lightweight so server costs are affordable. It can also be
  self-hosted meaning it can run on your own server if you are concerned about
  privacy. If you are really concerned then you can even run Open Classroom
  without giving it internet access using a firewall.
