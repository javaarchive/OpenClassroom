<h3>Hello Teacher!</h3>
<p>
  As a teacher, you have the ability to create classes and have your students
  join them. You can also promote other people to a teacher and demote those
  that you accidentally promote. We recommend your email be on the pernameant
  teacher list to prevent accidental demotion. For more information about the
  pernameant teacher list please contact whoever is in charge of running

<h4>Create a classroom</h4>
<form class="ui form" action="/create_classroom" method="POST">
  <div class="field">
    <label>Classroom Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="classroom-name" placeholder="Classroom Name" />
  </div>
  <div class="field">

  <p>
    Hold Up! Before you create a new classroom, we ask you to look up at your
    address bar(the place where you type website names in), and ensure that
    there is a closed lock or it says https://. Otherwise your connection may be
    insecure and hackers will steal your credentials. If you are in charge of
    {{brand}} you can also enable to the force_https option in the configuration.
